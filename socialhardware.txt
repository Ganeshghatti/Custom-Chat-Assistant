Company Name : Social Hardware International


Tagline- 
Building immersive, AR-powered telerobotic systems for hazardous operations.


Overview-
Founded in 2017, Social Hardware is a Bengaluru-based startup dedicated to enhancing and protecting lives through innovative technology. Initially focused on assistive devices for underserved communities, the company gained national attention in 2021 with its collaboration with Cadbury Celebrations for the #MyFirstRakhi campaign, providing prostheses that enabled children with upper limb differences to fully engage in the Raksha Bandhan tradition. The prostheses, which offered a sense of touch, were provided at no cost, highlighting Social Hardware’s commitment to inclusivity. The campaign garnered widespread attention, reaching 2.7 crore views on YouTube, and was praised for promoting inclusivity in cultural practices, marking a significant step in making assistive technology more accessible and integrated into cultural traditions in India. Building on its expertise in bionics and prosthetics, the company expanded into field robotics, developing the Eclipse Remote Systems—teleoperated platforms designed for high-risk tasks like bomb disposal and search and rescue. Featuring immersive augmented reality (AR) controls, these systems ensure seamless human-machine interaction, allowing operators to perform hazardous tasks with precision and safety from a distance. Social Hardware is actively seeking industry partners to co-develop new models in the Eclipse Series—each crafted to address specialized needs in high-risk sectors. Organizations interested in exploring how Social Hardware’s Eclipse Series can transform their approach to safety and efficiency are invited to schedule a demo or discuss potential collaborations.

Company Background
At Social Hardware, we specialise in building advanced robotic systems tailored for high-risk operations in hazardous environments.

To give you a quick background on our company, Social Hardware was founded in 2017, we’re registered with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade and we’re MSME certified.

Today, we operate from three locations. In Bengaluru, we have a 4,400 sq. ft. R&D lab focused on robotic operating systems and digital manufacturing. And in Gandhinagar, we have a 4,000 sq. ft. facility dedicated to parts manufacturing and PCB production, and in Hebbal we have our corporate office.
We’re also ISO 9001:2015 certified for quality management and ISO 10218-1:2011 certified for meeting global safety standards for industrial robots.
Product Overview
Regarding our Eclipse robotic systems themselves:
* They are certified to operate in temperatures ranging from -10°C to +50°C.
* They meet IP57 standards, ensuring they’re protected against dust and water exposure, as well as EMI/EMC standard compliance and safety certification for hazardous material handling.
* Over 70% of our components are developed in-house, which lets us maintain strict quality control while also supporting the Make in India initiative, which we’re very passionate about.
* For manufacturing, we use a combination of steel and aluminum alloys enhanced with 3D-printed carbon fiber components to balance weight with durability.
The system also features dual 6-DOF robotic arms—which is something that none of our direct competitors are currently offering—along with 10-DOF bionic hands for precision tasks. In addition to this, we also have a modular, hot-swappable tool system that allows the bionic hands to be quickly swapped with bespoke tools designed for industry specific tasks without powering down the system.

We also offer the option of immersive extended reality (XR) control through a VR headset, which significantly enhances situational awareness. This system allows the operator to experience the robot's environment directly from its perspective with a 110° field of view, making it feel like a seamless extension of their own body. 
We’ve coupled this with a gesture-based control system that makes it incredibly intuitive and easy for operators to interact with and manipulate the robot's surroundings in a natural way, as the robot is programmed to remotely mimic their actions in near real-time.
Currently, the system offers 120 minutes of continuous battery life, a payload capacity of 1.45 kg per arm—customizable up to 5 kg—and a wireless range of 300 meters between communication devices, or up to 1 kilometer with a wired connection, both secured using AES-256 encryption with under 5ms latency.

We also have inhouse capability to customize the robots to your specific industry requirements, which includes tool attachments and sensor modules.

Regarding mobility, the robot has vulcanised rubber tank tracks capable of traversing uneven terrain with up to a 30° incline at a maximum speed of 2.8 m/s. 
The stow dimensions of the bot are less than 1 metre squared, making storage convenient. 
Maintenance contracts and spare parts are available.

Comprehensive training is offered for operation and maintenance.

A RaaS model is also available with 6-month minimum commitment.
